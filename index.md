## SKAML

The Skeletal Assessment Markup Language proposed here fits into the gap of XML-based description languages between descriptions of human motion on an abstract level and descriptions of the human biomechanics. SKAML describes the skeletal system of a human body from a full-body motion capture observer perspective. It is not possible nor intended to describe details of the human biomechanics with SKAML. Implementors may refer to the [XSD-specification](SKAML.xsd).
